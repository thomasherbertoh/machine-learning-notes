## Other Learning Techniques

- #Semi-supervised-learning
  - Only ask humans to label things the model isn't sure about
  - Avoids wasting too much human time
- #Active-learning

## Obtaining Data

- Are we getting the data online or offline?
- Does our model have to adapt in real-time to a changing environment?

## Types of models

- Generative vs discriminative
- Parametric vs non-parametric
