# Lazy vs. Eager Learning

## Lazy Learning

Lazy learning #algorithms simply store the training data (or perform limited processing) and only operate when given a test example. This allows for very quick training, but predictions can be quite slow.

### Examples of Lazy Learning #Algorithms

- #K-NN

## Eager Learning

Eager learning #algorithms construct a classification model given a training set before receiving new test data to classify. This means that training is generally slow, but predictions are relatively quick.
