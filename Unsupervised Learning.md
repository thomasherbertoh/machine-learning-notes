# Unsupervised Learning

```ad-definition
Building a model using examples **without labels** that learns to predict new examples
```

Given $T = {x_1, x_m}$ ^[no $y$ because there are no labels] output a hidden structure behind the various $x$ values, that being the #clusters.

## #Clustering

- Social network analysis
- Genomics ^[group individuals by genetic similarity]
- Image segmentation ^[distinguishing different parts or layers of an image]
- Anomaly detection
  - Analyse a set of events or objects and flag some of them as being unusual or atypical ^[credit card fraud detection, video surveillance]

## #Dimensionality-reduction

- Reduce the number of variables in consideration by obtaining a set of princial variables

### Applications

- Inspecting a classification algorithm
  - In digit recognition, each digit could be classed as being sets of data points whose values come out close to one another in an N-dimensional space
